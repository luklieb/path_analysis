# path_analysis_hw
I'm sitting next to a multi-ton, 6dof, Kuka robot arm. It's not doing what I want it to do.

The robot takes in a list of points and does its best to go to those points in order. The thing is, I just fed it a bunch of points and the robot didn't look right. For instance, there is a section of the path I sent to the robot that is a bunch of circles, and instead of tracing out circles, the robot just sat there unmoving... Something is definitely amiss. 

## The ask
Here's where you come in. I want to know why the robots didn't follow my instructions. Fortunately for us, I managed to save some logs during the run:
 - path.csv These are the points I told the robot to go to. Generally, a bunch of loops in the xy plane. 
 - tracker.csv This is where the robot went as measured by some optical trackers. 

Your task: generate insights. The more graphs and sick visualizations, the better. Generally, what parameters of the input points correlate with error? 

## A word of caution about those logs...
 - The tracker points are logged in the tracker coordinates. No idea what the transform is between those and the coordinates of the path. Fortunately, I threw in some "registration points" at the top of the path. Maybe those can help.
 - Due to some clock desynchrony, it appears that the time stamps in tracker.csv might be shifted from the time stamps in path.csv. Consider it pretty close, but I'm all ears if you can think of a way to handle that. 
 - The data here is very raw and potentially insufficient for grand conclusions. Do your best, and document your assumptions. 

## Submission
In order to submit the assignment, do the following:

1. Navigate to GitHub's project import page: [https://github.com/new/import](https://github.com/new/import)

2. In the box titled "Your old repository's clone URL", paste the homework repository's link: [https://github.com/Machina-Labs/path_analysis_hw](https://github.com/Machina-Labs/path_analysis_hw)

3. In the box titled "Repository Name", add a name for your local homework (ex. `path_analysis_soln`)

4. Set privacy level to "Public", then click "Begin Import" button at bottom of the page.

5. Develop your homework solution in the cloned repository and push it to Github when you're done. Extra points for good Git hygiene.

6. Send us the link to your repository.


May your servo drives be warm, and your hydraulic fluid never leak.

# How to run

## Installation of required python packages

With python3 (tested with python3.8) install required packages with

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

(You probably want to use a virtual environment for this)

## Running jupyter notebook in a browser

`jupyter-notebook analysis.ipynb`

## Running jupyter notebook in VSCode

Just open the notebook and select the correct kernel (virtual environment) in the upper right corner

## Matplotlib backend

In the second cell you can set the backend for matplot lib.
If you're working on a local machine I suggest you use
`%matplotlib qt`

Of course, if you'd like to use a different one, feel free to do so!

When using the remote-ssh functionality of VSCode, you can use
`%matplotlib ipympl` for interactive plots within VSCode
